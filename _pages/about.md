Hi, I'm Yanran Lin, a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Utah advised by Prof. Luis Garcia.  I am always passionate about research that combines technology and human-centered approaches, aiming to address real-world challenges. My current work focuses on leveraging augmented reality to design naturalistic environments for neuroscience experiments, exploring how AR can enhance the understanding of brain behavior in dynamic settings. These challenges have driven my broader interest in Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality Systems, Human-Computer Interaction, Context Awareness, Dynamic SLAM, and Neuro-Symbolic Modeling.
