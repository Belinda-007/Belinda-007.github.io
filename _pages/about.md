Hi, I'm Yanran Lin, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Utah. My research focuses on augmented reality, neuroscience, and leveraging technology to study human interaction and cognitive processes. I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from University of Michigan. During my undergraduate studies, I developed a strong interest in human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence, which eventually led me to pursue a Ph.D.
